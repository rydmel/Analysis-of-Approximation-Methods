# Analysis-of-Approximation-Methods

This paper investigates three methods for approximating the solutions of first-order differential equations: Euler’s
method, Improved Euler’s method, and the Runge-Kutta method. The approximations are accomplished using the
sequence and approach spelled out in Exploration 7.5 in the textbook  <i>Differential equations, dynamical systems, and an introduction to chaos / Morris W. Hirsch, Stephen Smale, Robert L. Devaney</i>.
The specific formulas and calculations are implemented in an EXCEL spreadsheet. Although I also performed the
implementation in Python as well (getting results identical to those from EXCEL), I have chosen to display the EXCEL-based results because they are more simple, intuitive, and far more convenient to visualize and tweak, and also
because the exercise explicitly recommends “using a spreadsheet to make these lengthy calculations”. Parts of the
spreadsheet are displayed in this paper.
